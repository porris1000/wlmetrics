## Abstract

This library uses employee worklogs downloaded from Jira in excel format to calculate various KPIs of employee performance. This information can also be viewed in a pdf report generated for each employee.

## Usage

```python
# read
from preprocess import read_worklogs_files
worklogs = read_worklogs_files()

#  preprocess
from preprocess import preprocess_worklogs
worklogs = preprocess_worklogs(worklogs)

# calculate
from calculate import calculate_metrics_by_year
years = range(2019, 2023)
users_and_metrics = calculate_metrics_by_year(worklogs, years)[0]

# report
from report import generate_reportsworklogs = read_worklogs_files()
year = 2022
history = range(2019, 2022)
generate_reports(users_and_metrics, year, history)

```
